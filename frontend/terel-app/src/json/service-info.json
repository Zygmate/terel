Because of that not all features are present already and many more will come in the future. Please also consider this is a side project we are working on in our free time.\n\nThis tool is also a homage to Troika Games for making such an awesome game.\n\nWhy 'Ter’El Blessing'?\nWell, Ter’El is the noble lesser god of wisdom which aligns perfectly with the core idea of this tool, create builds thinking ahead.\n\nYet another build creation and management tool?\nYes! The idea was born because of the lack of tools to allow the players to create a build and export an auto levelling scheme in to the game.\n\nWhat are the plans for the future?\nAside from the core features, we believe this project has the possibility to host a whole other bunch of features. Some of those features we already have in mind to add, and we are open to suggestions for more!"
