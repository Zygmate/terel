## About Auto Leveling Scheme

[Link to Forum documentation](https://terra-arcanum.com/forums/threads/tutorial-custom-level-schemes.18507/)

The auto leveling scheme uses 2 files to work properly [[#gamelevelname.mes]] and [[#gamelevel.mes]]

### gamelevelname.mes
#### Template

[base_template](Assets/gamelevelname.mes)


#### Syntax

_{scheme_id}{scheme_name}_

#### Parameters

> scheme_id

A positive integer greater or equal to 107.

>[!warning]
>Integer numbers from 0 to 49 are "reserved" for the base game schemes. Changing them may result in data loss, data corruption or an overall unplayable state of the game.

>scheme_name

A string with ? max characters. If the characters are too many the game will not show the scheme name, hence it will not me usable.

### gamelevel.mes

#### Template

[base_template](Assets/gamelevel.mes)

#### Syntax

_{scheme_id}-scheme_name		{point_1_allocation, point_2_allocation}_

#### Parameters

> scheme_id

A positive integer between 50 and 199. It links the schemes (this one with the same _scheme_id_ in [[#gamelevelname.mes]])

>-_scheme_name

Any string (no limit known) preceded with "-".

>[!note]
>It is a good practice to have the same name as the one stated in [[#gamelevelname.mes]], though it is not necessary. 

> point_n_allocation

Each point allocation is divided by a comma. refers to where the point is actually allocated.

The _point_n_allocation_ structure is as follows:

> _valid_name target_

_valid_names_ is a spell, tech skill, tech degree, attribute, health or mana alias (refer to the table below) that is valid.

>The allocation point represents the "goal" to achieve i.e. "st 20" translates to "add points until strength is at 20".
>Also note that saying "melee 20" will add 18 points in Dexterity too, since it is a requirement to achieve it.
