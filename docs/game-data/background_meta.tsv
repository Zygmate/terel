Your senses of touch, hearing, and smell increased to compensate for your blindness, resulting in a bonus to Perception (+5). However, you suffered physically, leading to penalties in Strength (-3), Dexterity (-3), and Constitution (-5). As a young adult, your parents, out of desperation, paid for the services of a renowned, if unorthodox physician, who miraculously restored your sight.

Cursed with both trollish looks and mannerisms, you receive severe penalties to Beauty (-4) and Charisma (-4).

You studied Explosives, gaining +20 Expertise, and you burned their homes! Burned them to the ground! Ha ha! Then you ran away from home and snuck aboard the IFS Zephyr, which seemed highly flammable and an excellent target. You probably would have torched the zeppelin if it hadn't been shot down.	627
